	// insensitive match there.

	// such as the one in Rust where given a string literal if you get
	// all the case options of that such as turning foo into foo Foo fOo FOo foO FoO fOO FOO

	// like Aho-Corasick or Rabin-Karp to get multi match would be a better idea so you
	// can match all of the input in one pass.
	//
	// If the needle is over some amount of characters long you chop off the first few
	// and then search for those. However this means you are not finding actual matches and as such
