Sloc Cloc and Code (scc)
------------------------

<img alt="scc" src=https://github.com/boyter/scc/raw/master/scc.jpg>

A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting physical the lines of code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

Goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like sloccount and to estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators. In short one tool to rule them all.

Also it has a very short name which is easy to type `scc`. 

If you don't like sloc cloc and code feel free to use the name `Succinct Code Counter`.

### Pitch

Why use `scc`?

 - It is very fast and gets faster the more CPU you throw at it
 - Accurate
 - Works very well across multiple platforms without slowdown (Windows, Linux, macOS)
 - Large language support
 - Can ignore duplicate files
 - Has complexity estimations
 - You need to tell the difference between Coq and Verilog in the same directory
 - cloc yaml output support so potentially a drop in replacement for some users
 - Can identify or ignore minified files
 - Able to identify many #! files
 - Can ignore large files by lines or bytes

Why not use `scc`?

 - You don't like Go for some reason
 - It cannot count D source with different nested multi-line comments correctly https://github.com/boyter/scc/issues/27

### Usage

Command line usage of `scc` is designed to be as simple as possible.
Full details can be found in `scc --help` or `scc -h`.

```

Note that you don't have to specify the directory you want to run against. Running `scc` will assume you want to run against the current directory.

You can also run against multiple files or directories `scc directory1 directory2 file1 file2` with the results aggregated in the output.

### Interesting Use Cases

Used inside Intel Nemu Hypervisor to track code changes between revisions https://github.com/intel/nemu/blob/topic/virt-x86/tools/cloc-change.sh#L9
Appears to also be used inside both http://codescoop.com/ and https://pinpoint.com/

### Features

`scc` uses a small state machine in order to determine what state the code is when it reaches a newline `\n`. As such it is aware of and able to count

 - Single Line Comments
 - Multi Line Comments
 - Strings
 - Multi Line Strings
 - Blank lines

Because of this it is able to accurately determine if a comment is in a string or is actually a comment.

It also attempts to count the complexity of code. This is done by checking for branching operations in the code. For example, each of the following `for if switch while else || && != ==` if encountered in Java would increment that files complexity by one.


### Complexity Estimates

Lets take a minute to discuss the complexity estimate itself.

The complexity estimate is really just a number that is only comparable to files in the same language. It should not be used to compare languages directly without weighting them. The reason for this is that its calculated by looking for branch and loop statements in the code and incrementing a counter for that file.

Because some languages don't have loops and instead use recursion they can have a lower complexity count. Does this mean they are less complex? Probably not, but the tool cannot see this because it does not build an AST of the code as it only scans through it.

Generally though the complexity there is to help estimate between projects written in the same language, or for finding the most complex file in a project `scc --by-file -s complexity` which can be useful when you are estimating on how hard something is to maintain, or when looking for those files that should probably be refactored.

### Large File Detection

You can have `scc` exclude large files from the output. 

The option to do so is `--no-large` which by default will exclude files over 1,000,000 bytes or 40,000 lines.

You can control the size of either value using `--large-byte-count` or `--large-line-count`.

For example to exclude files over 1,000 lines and 50kb you could use the following,

`scc --no-large --large-byte-count 50000 --large-line-count 1000`

### Minified/Generated File Detection

You can have `scc` identify and optionally remove files identified as being minified or generated from the output.

You can do so by enabling the `-z` flag like so `scc -z` which will identify any file with an average line byte size >= 255 (by default) as being minified.

Minified files appear like so in the output.

```
$ scc --no-cocomo -z ./examples/minified/jquery-3.1.1.min.js
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Language                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
JavaScript (min)             1         4        0         1        3         17
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                        1         4        0         1        3         17
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Minified files are indicated with the text `(min)` after the language name.

You can control the average line byte size using `--min-gen-line-length` such as `scc -z --min-gen-line-length 1`. Please note you need `-z` as modifying this value does not imply minified detection.

You can exclude minified files from the count totally using the flag `--no-min-gen`. Files which match the minified check will be excluded from the output.

### Output Formats

By default `scc` will output to the console. However you can produce output in other formats if you require.

The different options are `tabular, wide, json, csv, cloc-yaml, html, html-table`. 

Note that you can write `scc` output to disk using the `-o, --output` option. This allows you to specify a file to
write your output to. For example `scc -f html -o output.html` will run `scc` against the current directory, and output
the results in html to the file `output.html`.

#### Tabular 

This is the default output format when scc is run.

#### Wide 

Wide produces some additional information which is the complexity/lines metric. This can be useful when trying to
identify the most complex file inside a project based on the complexity estimate.

#### JSON

JSON produces JSON output. Mostly designed to allow `scc` to feed into other programs.

#### CSV

CSV as an option is good for importing into a spreadsheet for analysis. 

#### cloc-yaml 

Is a drop in replacement for cloc using its yaml output option. This is quite often used for passing into other 
build systems and can help with replacing cloc if required.

#### HTML and HTML-TABLE

The HTML output options produce a minimal html report using a table that is either standalone `html` or as just a table `html-table`
which can be injected into your own HTML pages. The only difference between the two is that the `html` option includes 
html head and body tags with minimal styling.

The markup is designed to allow your own custom styles to be applied. An example report
[is here to view](SCC-OUTPUT-REPORT.html).

Note that the HTML options follow the command line options, so you can use  `scc --by-file -f html` to produce a report with every
file and not just the summary.

### Performance

Generally `scc` will the fastest code counter compared to any I am aware of and have compared against. The below comparisons are taken from the fastest alternative counters. See `Other similar projects` above to see all of the other code counters compared against. It is designed to scale to as many CPU's cores as you can provide.

However if you want greater performance and you have RAM to spare you can disable the garbage collector like the following on linux `GOGC=-1 scc .` which should speed things up considerably. For some repositories turning off the code complexity calculation via `-c` can reduce runtime as well.

Benchmarks are run on fresh 32 Core CPU Optimised Digital Ocean Virtual Machine 2019/10/10 all done using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) with 3 warm-up runs and 10 timed runs.

### CI/CD Support

Some CI/CD systems which will remain nameless do not work very well with the box-lines used by `scc`. To support those systems better there is an option `--ci` which will change the default output to ASCII only.

```
$ scc --ci main.go

### Development

If you want to hack away feel free! PR's are accepted. Some things to keep in mind. If you want to change a language definition you need to update `languages.json` and then run `go generate` which will convert it into the `processor/constants.go` file.

For all other changes ensure you run all tests before submitting. You can do so using `go test ./...`. However for maximum coverage please run `test-all.sh` which will run `gofmt`, unit tests, race detector and then all of the integration tests. All of those must pass to ensure a stable release.

### API Support

The core part of `scc` which is the counting engine is exposed publicly to be integrated into other Go applications. See https://github.com/pinpt/ripsrc for an example of how to do this. However as a quick start consider the following,

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"github.com/boyter/scc/processor"
)

type statsProcessor struct{}

func (p *statsProcessor) ProcessLine(job *processor.FileJob, currentLine int64, lineType processor.LineType) bool {
	switch lineType {
	case processor.LINE_BLANK:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "BLANK")
	case processor.LINE_CODE:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "CODE")
	case processor.LINE_COMMENT:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "COMMENT")
	}
	return true
}

### Adding/Modifying Languages

To add or modify a language you will need to edit the `languages.json` file in the root of the project, and then run `go generate` to build it into the application. You can then `go install` or `go build` as normal to produce the binary with your modifications.

### Issues

Its possible that you may see the counts vary between runs. This usually means one of two things. Either something is changing or locking the files under scc, or that you are hitting ulimit restrictions. To change the ulimit see the following links.

 - https://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6#306555
 - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108174/how-to-persistently-control-maximum-system-resource-consumption-on-mac/221988#221988
 - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61334
 - https://serverfault.com/questions/356962/where-are-the-default-ulimit-values-set-linux-centos
 - https://www.tecmint.com/increase-set-open-file-limits-in-linux/

To help identify this issue run scc like so `scc -v .` and look for the message `too many open files` in the output. If it is there you can rectify it by setting your ulimit to a higher value.

### Low Memory

If you are running `scc` in a low memory environment < 512 MB of RAM you may need to set `--filegccount` or `--fgc` to a lower value such as `0` to force the garbage collector to be on at all times.

A sign that this is required will be `scc` crashing with panic errors.

### Tests

scc is pretty well tested with many unit, integration and benchmarks to ensure that it is fast and complete.

### Package

Run go build for windows and linux then the following in linux, keep in mind need to update the version

```
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip scc
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=386 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-i386-apple-darwin.zip scc
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-x86_64-pc-windows.zip scc.exe
GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-i386-pc-windows.zip scc.exe
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.zip scc
GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 go build -ldflags="-s -w" && zip -r9 scc-2.11.0-i386-unknown-linux.zip scc
```

### Badges (beta)

You can use `scc` to provide badges on your github/bitbucket/gitlab open repositories. For example, [![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
 The format to do so is,

https://sloc.xyz/PROVIDER/USER/REPO

An example of the badge for `scc` is included below, and is used on this page.

```
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
```

By default the badge will show the repo's lines count. You can also specify for it to show a different category, by using the `?category=` query string. 

Valid values include `code, blanks, lines, comments, cocomo` and examples of the appearance are included below.

[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=code)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=blanks)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=lines)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=comments)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)


For `cocomo` you can also set the `avg-wage` value similar to `scc` itself. For example,

https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo&avg-wage=1
https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo&avg-wage=100000 

Note that the avg-wage value must be a positive integer otherwise it will revert back to the default value of 56286.

*NB* it may not work for VERY large repositories (has been tested on Apache hadoop/spark without issue).

### Languages

List of supported languages. The master version of `scc` supports 239 languages at last count. Note that this is always assumed that you built from master, and it might trail behind what is actually supported. To see what your version of `scc` supports run `scc --languages`
