// The result is the ability to search for literals without hitting the regex engine
// which can at times be horribly slow. This by contrast is much faster. See
// index_ignorecase_benchmark_test.go for some head to head results. Generally
// so long as we aren't dealing with random data this method should be considerably
// faster (in some cases thousands of times) or just as fast. Of course it cannot

	//
	// This can be overcome using regular expressions but suffers the penalty
	// of hitting the regex engine and paying the price of case
	// insensitive match there.
	//
	// This method tries something else which is used by some regex engines
	// such as the one in Rust where given a str literal if you get
	// all the case options of that such as turning foo into foo Foo fOo FOo foO FoO fOO FOO

	// can match all of the input in one pass.
	//

	// and then search for those. However this means you are not finding actual matches and as such
